                    If anything hinders your
                    desire to settle down, trust that God will handle it. Spiritual
                    complications can sometimes prevent people from getting married, but God
                    has said that it's not good for man to be alone, and finding a wife is a
                    good thing that brings favor from the Lord. We rely on these scriptures
                    and the Ministry of the Holy Spirit to help those who are sincere and
                    ready to find a partner for marriage.
                    Numerous households face challenges due to negative environmental
                    influences, peer pressure, and other complexities. Some homes are
                    struggling to stay afloat, while others have already crumbled. However,
                    there is a glimmer of hope - like the fig tree that can regrow even
                    after being cut down.
                   
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will hold these meetings as guided by the Lord to tackle the
                    spiritual task of reclaiming homes from the devil.
                    We strongly believe that we can help people achieve their desire for
                    marriage and assist those on the brink of it falling apart. We are here
                    to salvage and deliver hope to those in need.
                    Every household can benefit from prayers. They can help prevent bad
                    situations and sustain good ones. No problem in a home is too big for
                    the power of God and prayer to handle and resolve.
                    As humans, we all face struggles and can benefit from this prayer. God
                    is willing and able to provide assistance.

                    Please note the following. 
                    Attendance is free, but registration is compulsory.
                    This is an instructed program, and it is interdenominational.
                    Participants are to dress modestly and moderately.
                    It shall be appreciated if you can wait on the Lord on this day 
                    with no food, water, or coffee before coming because we shall be 
                    taking communion at a particular point in the service.
                    Absolute faith and concentration are needed. God has the ability 
                    and power to deliver our miracles at the same time and day, but we 
                    are separated by our faith. There is no need to come without faith 
                    in the Lord Jesus Christ.
                    Come with a portion of bread and a small juice drink for your communion.
                     Communion shall not be served on that day from the altar. Come with your 
                     communion ingredients. COME WITH REAL BREAD AND DRINKS. Jesus broke the bread.
                      We shall do it according to instructions to get the expected results.
                    This is a solemn assembly, and we should treat it as one.
                    This shall be an annual event. God has commanded us to run five events according to 
                    Acts 10:38. This is one of the five programs.
                    Do not forget to register. It is compulsory, please. You can use the QR code on the 
                    flier or this page.
