                    Welcome to the Thanksgiving ministry! Our annual
                    praise, worship, and testimony night promises to be a grand event. It's
                    a miraculous gathering where many people will dance into their
                    long-awaited miracles. Get ready for unusual miracles, signs, and
                    wonders!
                    As we read the scriptures, we noticed that victories were achieved by
                    praising God, as He had instructed.
                    In the Old Testament, we learn God's instruction to Jehoshaphat to raise
                    singers.
                    2 Chronicles 20:14-19
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                    14 Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah,
                    the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of
                    the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. 15 And he said,
                    "Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you,
                    King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the Lord to you: 'Do not be afraid nor
                    dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours,
                    but God's. 16 Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by
                    the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the [d]brook
                    before the Wilderness of Jeruel. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    17 You will not need to fight in this
                    battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the
                    Lord, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!' Do not fear or be
                    dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord is with you."
                    18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all
                    Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the Lord, worshiping
                    the Lord. 19 Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of
                    the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel
                    with voices loud and high.

                    And in the New Testament, we cannot forget the experience of Paul and
                    Silas in prison.

                    Acts 16:25-26

                    25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and
                    the prisoners heard them.
                    26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of
                    the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and
                    every one's bands were loosed.

                    It's important to acknowledge that praising God is a powerful way to
                    demonstrate His divine power and should not be underestimated.

                    We will host an annual event that celebrates praise, worship,
                    thanksgiving, and testimony. This event will be inclusive of all races
                    and tribes and will be filled with vibrant colors and a strong spiritual
                    presence.
