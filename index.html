            <h1>ENOCH & FRIENDS FOUNDATION (E&FF)</h1>
            <p>
              The Enoch & Friends Foundation, a non-profit organization 
              based on the Christian faith, was registered in Maryland, 
              USA, in 2019. Its mission is to reach millions of people 
              worldwide through outreach efforts.
              Enoch Akinsola has a special mission to the world based on 
              Acts 10:38. His goal is to encourage a global audience to follow 
              in the footsteps of the Lord and carry out His teachings as 
              commanded in John 14:12. <br> <br>
              True and authentic friendships are more important than ever in 
              today's world. We are faced with many challenges that can feel 
              overwhelming, but with the support of real friends, we can create 
              a better world for ourselves and others. Jesus Christ referred to 
              His disciples as friends, and we, too, can strive to be friends by 
              doing good and living as the works of God, as stated in Ephesians 2:10. <br> <br>
              Who are the friends in this idea? They are spiritual partners, collaborators, 
              and givers or donors who will support each other through prayer and assistance 
              whenever needed. Anyone who receives assistance will also be considered a partner on this journey.
              Please make sure to attend all meetings that will be scheduled by COVENANT PARTNERS,
              ee which is the ministry branch of the foundation.</p>

          <p class="main-title">HEAR MY CRY, O LORD!- It has been announced that God will grant the
            prayers of married couples waiting for children. This special event will
            happen once a year in various locations around the world, where God will
            intervene and help solve complicated issues. Just like in the Bible
            story of Hannah, many families will finally receive their heart's
            desires. Be prepared for this miraculous event.

          <p> GLOBAL MIRACLE DANCE- Welcome to the Thanksgiving ministry! Our annual
            praise, worship, and testimony night promises to be a grand event. It's
            a miraculous gathering where many people will dance into their
            long-awaited miracles. Get ready for unusual miracles, signs, and
            wonders!

          <br>
            <p>FAMILY & MARRIAGE- WHEN IT CAN TAKE ONLY GOD!- If anything hinders your
              desire to settle down, trust that God will handle it. Spiritual
              complications can sometimes prevent people from getting married, but God
              has said that it's not good for man to be alone, and finding a wife is a
              good thing that brings favor from the Lord. We rely on these scriptures
              and the ministry of the Holy Spirit to help those who are sincere and
              ready to find a partner for marriage.

            <p>BETHESDA, THE HEALING POOL- God has never ceased to heal people, so the
              healing pool is always active. To receive healing, one must have faith
              and a strong desire for it. God has designated specific vessels for
              different individuals and circumstances. You may receive healing through
              one of these channels, and it will be a cherished experience.

              YOUTHS & SINGLES- The Lord holds a special place in his heart for young
              people and single people. Losing your youth means losing your future. We
              will work to reach out to college campuses and prepare young people for
              the spiritual challenges they will face in the world. We will not let
              darkness overpower our light. Let us focus on mentoring in Spirit and
              truth.
