            <h3>ENOCH & FRIENDS FOUNDATION (E&FF)</h3>
            <p>
              The Enoch & Friends Foundation, a non-profit organization 
              based on the Christian faith, was registered in Maryland, 
              USA, in 2019. Its mission is to reach millions of people 
              worldwide through outreach efforts.
              Enoch Akinsola has a special mission to the world based on 
              Acts 10:38. His goal is to encourage a global audience to follow 
              in the footsteps of the Lord and carry out His teachings as 
              commanded in John 14:12. <br> <br>
              True and authentic friendships are more important than ever in 
              today's world. We are faced with many challenges that can feel 
              overwhelming, but with the support of real friends, we can create 
              a better world for ourselves and others. Jesus Christ referred to 
              His disciples as friends, and we, too, can strive to be friends by 
              doing good and living as the works of God, as stated in Ephesians 2:10. <br> <br>
              Who are the friends in this idea? They are spiritual partners, collaborators, 
              and givers or donors who will support each other through prayer and assistance 
              whenever needed. Anyone who receives assistance will also be considered a partner on this journey.
              Please make sure to attend all meetings that will be scheduled by COVENANT PARTNERS,
               which is the ministry branch of the foundation.

        <h4>COVENANT PARTNERS'S MANDATE </h4>
        <p>
     

          ACTS 10:38 <br>

          The Ministry's assignments are based on Acts 10:38, as God never sends anyone without a word.
          As an escape route, I registered Enoch & Friends Foundation in Maryland, USA, in 2019 to do other things besides the Ministry's work. I have substituted other things to replace the work of the Ministry in the last twenty-four years. I have had fliers for all these programs designed since 2015, but I had done everything to escape this Heavenly call until I was compelled to do this because someone out there has cried to God.

          "How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him." NIV

          "And you know that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Then Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him." NLT

          "How God anointed and consecrated Jesus of Nazareth with the [Holy] Spirit and with strength and ability and power; how He went about doing good and, [a]in particular, curing all who were harassed and oppressed by [the power of] the devil, for God was with Him." (ABCE)

          While Jesus was leaving the stage, He made a promise. John 14:12 (Amplified Bible, Classic Edition says,

          "I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, if anyone steadfastly believes in Me, he will himself be able to do the things that I do; and he will do even greater things than these, because I go to the Father."

          There are two major concerns in the scriptures above, 
          i. You will do the works I do.
          ii. You will do greater work than this.

          How would you be able to do the works I do before thinking of doing greater work than this? You must be empowered with Acts 10:38 and align with Ephesians 2:10

          10 For we are God's [own] handiwork (His workmanship), [d]recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].

          With these scriptural arsenals, the world is about to witness new but strange waves of revival. God will prove Himself as the faithful sender.

              Every family desires children, but some individuals face concerns. 
              Some people know why they cannot give birth or become pregnant, 
              while others are not. It doesn't matter whether you know or not. 
              God's acts are beyond human understanding.
              I prayed with several women in Africa years ago, many with children. 
              Though I cannot remember all of them, I recall a boy named Wonder. 
              He was born in 2000 to a mother who had never been pregnant and was 
              considered over-aged. We met at church while she was living with her 
              second husband and became closer as I ministered to her with scripture.
               She eventually gave birth to her child.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              As a believer, all our prayers were answered by God. It was as if the 
              Lord Himself had given us the assignment, and miraculous things happened. 
              I am confident that God has commissioned our Ministry, and greater grace 
              will spread across our assignment.
              God remembers those properly married - a man and a woman as husband and wife.
               In the first part of "Hear My Cry, O Lord," He promises to wipe away their tears. 
              If you can attend this meeting, God might have designed your fruitfulness, and by 
              next year, you will return to thank God.

              Throughout history, God has consistently healed people,
               which means the healing pool is constantly active.
                To receive healing, one must have faith and a strong desire for it.
                God has designated specific vessels for different individuals

                 which will be a cherished experience.
              This is one of the hallmarks of Jesus'
               assignment on the earth and is in line with the 
               mandate given to Enoch to run following Acts 10:38. 
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Healing is beneficial, especially when medicine has exhausted all options
               or appears hopeless. Jesus healed everyone brought to Him.
                Healing still happens. The pool will be stirred yearly on this platform.
              If you have faith, you can achieve miracles in the kingdom.
              This is as commanded.
              The Holy Spirit guides individuals who are ready for their healing miracles. 
              Those ready for their healing miracles will do whatever it takes to make it a date.
              It's important to remember that this event only takes place once a year.

                Numerous households face challenges due to negative environmental
                influences, peer pressure, and other complexities. Some homes are
                struggling to stay afloat, while others have already crumbled. However,
                there is a glimmer of hope - like the fig tree that can regrow even
                after being cut down.
            </p>
            <p>We will hold these meetings as guided by the Lord to tackle the
              spiritual task of reclaiming homes from the devil.
              We strongly believe that we can help people achieve their desire for
              marriage and assist those on the brink of it falling apart. We are here
              to salvage and deliver hope to those in need.
              Every household can benefit from prayers. They can help prevent bad
              situations and sustain good ones. No problem in a home is too big for
              the power of God and prayer to handle and resolve.
              As humans, we all face struggles and can benefit from this prayer. God
              is willing and able to provide assistance.</p>

              Welcome to the Thanksgiving ministry! Our annual
              praise, worship, and testimony night promises to be a grand event. It's
              a miraculous gathering where many people will dance into their
              long-awaited miracles. Get ready for unusual miracles, signs, and
              wonders!
              As we read the scriptures, we noticed that victories were achieved by
              praising God, as He had instructed.
              In the Old Testament, we learn God's instruction to Jehoshaphat to raise
              singers.
              2 Chronicles 20:14-19
            </p>
            <p>14 Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah,
              the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of
              the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. 15 And he said,
              "Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you,
              King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the Lord to you: 'Do not be afraid nor
              dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours,
              but God's. 16 Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by
              the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the [d]brook
              before the Wilderness of Jeruel. </p>
