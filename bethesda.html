                  Throughout history, God has consistently healed people,
                  which means the healing pool is constantly active.
                   To receive healing, one must have faith and a strong desire for it.
                   God has designated specific vessels for different individuals 
                   and circumstances. You may receive healing through one of these channels,
                    which will be a cherished experience.
                 This is one of the hallmarks of Jesus'
                  assignment on the earth and is in line with the 
                  mandate given to Enoch to run following Acts 10:38. 
                  
                </p>

                  Healing is beneficial, especially when medicine has exhausted all options
                  or appears hopeless. Jesus healed everyone brought to Him.
                   Healing still happens. The pool will be stirred yearly on this platform.
                 If you have faith, you can achieve miracles in the kingdom.
                 This is as commanded.
                 The Holy Spirit guides individuals who are ready for their healing miracles. 
                 Those ready for their healing miracles will do whatever it takes to make it a date.
                 It's important to remember that this event only takes place once a year.

                  Matthew 8:16 When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed.
                   And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.

                  Mark 6;56
                  Wherever He entered, into villages, cities, or the country, 
                  they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that they might 
                  just touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well.

                  Luke 5:17
                  Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were
                   Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every 
                   town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
